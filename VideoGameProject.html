<p>This game is a personal project I am planning on doing during the summer break between my 2nd and 3rd years at University. This game will be a 1st Person Arcade Shooter with very simple mechanics and graphics. I will be building this game in the Unity Engine.</p>
<p> The goal of this game is to score the highest score possible with a single shot. This single shot will penetrate through multiple enemies to score points. These enemies are moving laterally at random speeds. The more enemies you hit the more points you get, these points are controlled by where you hit the enemy on the body. Players will be ranked on online leaderboards by their highest score.</p>
